========== TESTSUITE README ==========

Run this command from this directory:
erl -pa ebin 

To launch 100 test clients:
testsuite:run_test(100).

By default this will connect to a server on localhost, if you need it to
connect somewhere else, you can do:

testsuite:run_test("10.0.0.2", 100).

Wait 60 seconds and a report will be written to file.
